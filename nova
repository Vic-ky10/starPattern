1. Is javascript a dynamically typed language or a statically typed 
language ?

        Javascript is a dynamically typed language. 
        It means all type checks are done at run time  When program is executing .
        So, we can just assign anything to the variable and it works fine.
       
       ``` Typescript is a statically typed language. All checks are performed at compile 
        time.``

             `   let a;
                a  0;
                console.log(a) // 0
                a = "Hello"
                console.log(a) // "Hello"`

 2. What are the different datatypes in javascript ? (Most asked)
       
       Primitive datatypes: 
                String
                number
                boolean
                null
                undefined
                Bigin
       Non-Primitive datatypes:
                Object
                Array
                Date



 3. What is Hoisting in javascript ? (Most asked)

        In other scripting/server side languages, variables or functions must be 
        declared before using it.

        In javascript, variables and functions can be used before declaring it. The 
        javascript compiler moves all the declarations of variables and functions on 
        top. so there will not be any error. This is called hoisting



 4. What are the various things hoisted in javascript ?
    Function declarations: Fully hoisted.
    var - Hoisted
    Arrow functions: Not hoisted
    Anonymous Function expressions: Not hoisted
    let -Hoisted but not initialized. (Temporal dead zone).
    const - Hoisted but not initialized. (Temporal dead zone)
    class declarations  Hoisted but not initialized.

5. What is temporal dead zone ?

    `
    It is a specific time period in the execution of javascript code where the 
    variables declared with let and const exists but cannot be accessed until the 
    value is assigned.
    Any attempt to access them result in reference errors.`
